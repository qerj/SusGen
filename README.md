# SusGen
Sus Gen is a open source program that finds out if a executable might be malicious.


*HOW TO* compile the program either x64 or x86 release, open the directory in which the binary was compiled in. 
Run SusGen.exe, the program will then open up a file explorer. Make sure to click the executable binary you want to find out if its malicious or not!
Once thats complete the program should respond with its theory.

Notes:
Not everything can be malicious even if SusGen says it is. Most likely the program is packed which is why virtual size is larger than disk size.
